Easy Double Shear Mounts
===
This mod is compatible with the Voron 2.4 and Trident.\
I used these to add Double Shear to my printed AB Motors but see no reason why they wouldn't work for the CNC Variants too as they use the motor fixing points only.

Bill of Materials
==
2x F695 Bearings (Fushi recommended) [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oConF27)
6x 40mm SHCS M3 Screws [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oo3MR5Z)
2x Long Shaft Motors, I used LDO S55 Motors (55mm Shaft)

Assembly
==
To assemble simply sandwich the F695 bearing between the baseplate and bearing holder and install the 3x 40mm screws through both parts, remove your original 30mm screws from the motor (hold on to it, it will fall otherwise) and then slide the double shear mount over the top of the motor shaft and tighten the 3 screws in opposite orders.

Repeat for the other motor.
